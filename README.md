## How to run

All puzzles are compiled into a single executable, and individual puzzles are selected using the first argument, which is the day number (01-25).

For example, to build and execute the puzzle for Day 2, run:

```shell
cargo run -- 02
```

To build optimized artifacts, run:

```shell
cargo build â€“-release --verbose
./target/release/aoc 02
```
